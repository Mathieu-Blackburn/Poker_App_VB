# Poker App VB

This is a video poker app done in VB.NET. 

**This is a solo school project that I took quite a bit further from the initial goal**

**It was made near the halfway point of my school course**

Everything it needs to run is already included in relative paths, it just needs to be compiled.
To play, simply insert 'coins' into the machine, place a bet and play!
